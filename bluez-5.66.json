A GATT service is represented by\na D-Bus object hierarchy where the root node corresponds to a service and the\nchild nodes represent characteristics and descriptors that belong to that\nservice. Each node must implement one of GattService1, GattCharacteristic1,\nor GattDescriptor1 interfaces described above, based on the attribute it\nrepresents. Each node must also implement the standard D-Bus Properties\ninterface to expose their properties. These objects collectively represent a\nGATT service definition.\n\nTo make service registration simple, BlueZ requires that all objects that belong\nto a GATT service be grouped under a D-Bus Object Manager that solely manages\nthe objects of that service. Hence, the standard DBus.ObjectManager interface\nmust be available on the root service path. An example application hierarchy\ncontaining two separate GATT services may look like this:\n\n-\u003e /com/example\n  |   - org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager\n  |\n  -\u003e /com/example/service0\n  | |   - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties\n  | |   - org.bluez.GattService1\n  | |\n  | -\u003e /com/example/service0/char0\n  | |     - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties\n  | |     - org.bluez.GattCharacteristic1\n  | |\n  | -\u003e /com/example/service0/char1\n  |   |   - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties\n  |   |   - org.bluez.GattCharacteristic1\n  |   |\n  |   -\u003e /com/example/service0/char1/desc0\n  |       - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties\n  |       - org.bluez.GattDescriptor1\n  |\n  -\u003e /com/example/service1\n    |   - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties\n    |   - org.bluez.GattService1\n    |\n    -\u003e /com/example/service1/char0\n        - org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties\n        - org.bluez.GattCharacteristic1\n\nWhen a service is registered, BlueZ will automatically obtain information about\nall objects using the service's Object Manager. Once a service has been\nregistered, the objects of a service should not be removed.
